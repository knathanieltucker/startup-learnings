# Distribution

Distribution fortunately or unfortunately has become an integral part of any startup's pitch and strategy. VCs expect that a startup's series A pitch or even seed will have a distribution strategy. From what I have learned from talking to marketers at large and small companies is not much, but it gives me confidence that any team with discipline and solid execution can become their own marketers without hiring an internal or relying on an external expert. 

I want to talk about two things below:

1. Branding
2. Marketing

Not only the high level, but what low level activities these should impact.

## Branding

Take all this with a grain of salt - I've heard one talk on this, nothing more, but it really resonated with me.

There are two important things to know about branding:

1. Branding is about being **authentic**. 
2. Branding is the first step to effective marketing

It's finding out about the company you are and acting true to that brand - not mixing your messaging. You'll want to find one that jives. The most important thing about the brand is that it authentically reflects your company and team.  

There are many ways to settle on that brand. The one that I have learned is called archetypal branding. 

### Archetypal Branding

This is just one tool to describe who your company is. In archetypal branding you relate your company to one of 12 story archetypes:

There is some backing to this way of creating a brand (some limbic system justifications). I like it because I like stories.

Once you settle on one or two of the archetypes you have the kernel of your company's brand, and the next step is to expound on it.

### Unfurling the Kernel of your Brand

Now that you have settled on one or two archetypes that best represent your team and company, you can use those to impact real world decisions about your company. The tone/feeling of the content and the creative should be derived from your archetype.

Take your archetype: the magician and the creator let's say. And use that to brainstorm different images and words. You'll need to blend in a bit of the industry lingo into it, but that will be your starting point. You should now dip your website, landing pages, creative, tone of your interviews, in this archetypal soup to ensure that you have a consistent messaging throughout. 

---

You can of course tailor your messaging to different behaviors, but straying outside that voice will make your brand and company less authentic. 

## Marketing

Marketing is a bigger beast than branding with plenty of pointy edges that are just waiting to prick you. One of the problems with marketing is that it is quite technical. If you are using an ad platform like facebook or google you, you'll need to understand how to run campaigns and measure the results without have large unexplained variations. 

All that being said, there are still some high level frameworks that can guide us in how we choose to market.

1. Behavior Personas
2. 

### Behavior Personas

A common technique used in marketing is a persona. This is a detailed illustration of a group of people that use your product. 

I think that this type of a tool can be helpful, but I have some caveats. 

#### Your company is not your personas

I think that using descriptions of people to understand who you are selling to can cause you to betray your brand. You might want to have messaging that is different from the tone of the brand in order to better appeal to those people.

In the short term this may pay off, but ultimately you can't be everything to everyone and nor should you be, especially if you are a smaller company.

As you mature you can have different offering that appeal to different folks (Uber pool vs uber black). And then those offerings themselves become brands. But the best companies have still have a consistent brand despite having many offerings (think Google or Apple).

#### Personas lead to Stereotypes

Having a persona can sometimes lead you in the wrong direction as well. The famous story here is about how the SUV was originally marketed to burley men, but the ultimately soccer moms became the big buyer. 

Having a persona be a description of a person causes all people, even the best of us, to form stereotypes of the customers which can be hard to break out of.

---

The solution to both of these is to use a behavior archetype. Instead of making a persona a person, you make it a behavior, eg. people needing to get home from a bar (in Uber's case).

Once you define that behavior you will want to start to understand those people better: what are their current solutions? Where do they look to find solutions? Where do they hang out? **How big is that market size?**

You'll want to understand them enough to be able to market to them!
