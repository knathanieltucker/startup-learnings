# Distribution

Distribution fortunately or unfortunately has become an integral part of any startup's pitch and strategy. VCs expect that a startup's series A pitch or even seed will have a distribution strategy. From what I have learned from talking to marketers at large and small companies is not much, but it gives me confidence that any team with discipline and solid execution can become their own marketers without hiring an internal or relying on an external expert. 

There are a couple of ways to pursue distribution:

1. Branding
2. Marketing
3. PR
4. Viral

I'll go through these, not only the high level, but what low level activities these should impact.

**Caveat** Most of the advice below is talking about consumer marketing, aka when you are looking to talk to the users of your product. There is a separate type of marketing called Corporate Marketing. This is specifically focused on targeting investors or employees etc. The purpose is to help get resources for your company (things you'd use). Different from people that will use your product.

## Branding

Take all this with a grain of salt - I've heard one talk on this, nothing more, but it really resonated with me.

There are two important things to know about branding:

1. Branding is about being **authentic**. 
2. Branding is the first step to effective marketing

It's finding out about the company you are and acting true to that brand - not mixing your messaging. You'll want to find one that jives. The most important thing about the brand is that it authentically reflects your company and team.  

There are many ways to settle on that brand. The one that I have learned is called archetypal branding. 

### Archetypal Branding

This is just one tool to describe who your company is. In archetypal branding you relate your company to one of 12 story archetypes:

There is some backing to this way of creating a brand (some limbic system justifications). I like it because I like stories.

---

Once you settle on one or two of the archetypes you have the kernel of your company's brand, and the next step is to expound on it.

### Unfurling the Kernel of your Brand

Now that you have settled on one or two archetypes that best represent your team and company, you can use those to impact real world decisions about your company. The tone/feeling of the content and the creative should be derived from your archetype.

Take your archetype: the magician and the creator let's say. And use that to brainstorm different images and words. You'll need to blend in a bit of the industry lingo into it, but that will be your starting point. You should now dip your website, landing pages, creative, tone of your interviews, in this archetypal soup to ensure that you have a consistent messaging throughout. 

---

You can of course tailor your messaging to different behaviors, but straying outside that voice will make your brand and company less authentic. 

## Marketing

Marketing is a bigger beast than branding with plenty of pointy edges that are just waiting to prick you. One of the problems with marketing is that it is quite technical. If you are using an ad platform like facebook or google you, you'll need to understand how to run campaigns and measure the results without have large unexplained variations. 

All that being said, there are still some high level frameworks that can guide us in how we choose to market.

1. Behavior Personas
2. Goal of Marketing
3. Types of Marketing

### Behavior Personas

A common technique used in marketing is a persona. This is a detailed illustration of a group of people that use your product. 

I think that this type of a tool can be helpful, but I have some caveats. 

#### Your company is not your personas

I think that using descriptions of people to understand who you are selling to can cause you to betray your brand. You might want to have messaging that is different from the tone of the brand in order to better appeal to those people.

In the short term this may pay off, but ultimately you can't be everything to everyone and nor should you be, especially if you are a smaller company.

As you mature you can have different offering that appeal to different folks (Uber pool vs uber black). And then those offerings themselves become brands. But the best companies have still have a consistent brand despite having many offerings (think Google or Apple).

#### Personas lead to Stereotypes

Having a persona can sometimes lead you in the wrong direction as well. The famous story here is about how the SUV was originally marketed to burley men, but the ultimately soccer moms became the big buyer. 

Having a persona be a description of a person causes all people, even the best of us, to form stereotypes of the customers which can be hard to break out of.

---

The solution to both of these is to use a behavior archetype. Instead of making a persona a person, you make it a behavior, eg. people needing to get home from a bar (in Uber's case).

Once you define that behavior you will want to start to understand those people better: what are their current solutions? Where do they look to find solutions? Where do they hang out? **How big is that market size?**

You'll want to understand them enough to be able to market to them!

Use this to understand where PR will work best and what type of marketing will work best.

### Goal of Marketing

A good framework to view the goal of marketing is: Know Feel Do. You want people that exhibit your behavior personas to:

* Know some information about your product, eg. know that your product is a solution to their problem
* Feel some way about your company or product, eg. feel relieved that they have found a solution to their problem
* Do something related to your product, eg. do purchase your product

Ultimately you are looking to change people's behavior via marketing. If that change does not fit into this framework, no problem. But if you are looking for a way to narrow down on your goal, then this can be a good framework.

### Types of Marketing

Now we are going to get a bit into specifics and some bits of advice on different channels. Choosing channels can be extremely important and there is a bit of intuition as to which channel you should pursue. But often the best advice is to try different channels for a couple of weeks and then if you don't see meaningful gains, try a different one out.

Below is a non-comprehensive list of channels and some small bits of advice for each:

* SEM
  * Branded keywords (capitalized words)
  * Non-branded keywords (intent)
* SEO
* Display ads
* Social
* Content Marketing
* Groupon/daily deals
* Street marketing
* B2B sales
* Direct mailers 

My only advice is you can be a bit quirky here. This is a great place to be creative!

## PR

Once you have created behavior personas and learn where people that exhibit this behavior hang out, then you can start targeting those areas with PR. 

## Viral

Viral marketing is trying to leverage your current customers to grow. 

There are many ways to achieve this but most involve some form of **referrals**. Often people make this more technical than it needs to be, but there are a couple of terms that people should know:

* Viral Coefficient - on average, how many people join your platform from viral each month / the number of people you have that month
* Payload - the amount of people you can hit with a viral blast (eg. enabling a type of referral discount)
* Conversion Rate - for each person hit, what is the chance they convert
* Frequency - the frequency of payloads

I have no specific advice for this subject other than experiment. Maybe I'll add something later.
