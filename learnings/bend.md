# Startups Bend

I used to think that the principal advantage of a startup is speed. But that's not 100% true. A large company moving in one direction can go very fast in that direction. Even faster than startups.

So what is the advantage that allows start ups to beat big companies? I think the word would be agility or flexibility. If a large company's core business fails, that company fails. If a small company's core business fails, they pivot. Pivoting isn't some thing a large company can do.

And it's good to think about the fundamental reasons why large companies aren't as flexible. I think in one sense it has to do with minimizing variance. 

Many positions in large companies thrive by minimizing variance. Big positive rewards are bounded, whereas the negative rewards are unbounded. When I worked at Facebook, I made changes to the way Facebook takes payments from advertisers that made them an estimated $40 million a year. When my wife worked at Google she made changes to the Google search that made Google over $1 billion a year. Sometimes I like to imagine to myself what would've happened if we were paid on commission ;). Of course we weren't, and the best that could happen is a promotion. However the worst I can happen at a large company is losing your job.

Now think about a startup. Again at a startup the worst thing that can happen is you losing your job. The negative outcomes are the same. But the positive outcomes are far different. If you make $1 billion for your startup, the positive rewards are outstanding. 

So startup founder's love variance, while employees at large companies hate it. And by doing things that constrict variance, you reduce your ability to be flexible. But what does that practically mean?

It means at large companies people are less likely to take new initiatives. The less likely to change strategy quickly. They're less likely to make exceptions. So as a startup you can do things for your partners, customers, employees, etc. that large companies couldn't do. Startups bend.

## Star crossed hiring

One very practical example of startups succeeding where large companies don't succeed is hiring. In general large companies have all the advantages. They can pay more, they have more benefits, there's more prestige that goes with working for them. But startups do have a couple of powerful tools in their hiring arsenal. And one of these is flexibility.

The best hiring seems fated. When both the company and the employees are looking for each other at the exact right time. The great thing about a startup you can afford to wait. One of the biggest disasters I have personally experienced in trying to hire, is forcing people to leave their previous company too early. It's such a turn off. Anytime you pressure somebody, you are pushing against them. And human beings have a natural response to being pushed: pushing back. Instead the much more effective way to hire is to say: come when you're ready.

That way as soon as the employee is ready they can join the startup. And for them that experienced feels starcrossed.
