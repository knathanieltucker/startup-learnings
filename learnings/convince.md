# Don't convince people, look for people that are already convinced

There's not too much more to say about this than what is said above. It's something I've experienced in fundraising, sales and hiring. I'll elaborate a bit more below.

This lesson is more about prioritization than anything else. You of course can convince people to your way of thinking. Very often it is not with arguments or logic, but by giving the other person time. It's just an often more effective use of your time to search out people that are more convinced.

I find many engineers to fall into this trap. Because in engineering convincing people through debate, argument and logic is common place. But in places where there is no optimal solution, convincing isn't so easy.

Maybe the fundamental idea here is that it's a big world out there. There's lots and lots of people with lots of different thoughts. It's easier to find a large niche in the modern day than it once was.
