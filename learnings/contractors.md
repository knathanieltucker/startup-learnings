# Contractors

Contractors epitomize agency and myopia problems. They don’t have skin in the game, and you will only work with them for a limited time. That being said, contractors can help fill temporary positions or lack of skills. So there is a place and time for contractors, you just need to know how to get the most out of the relationship.

Below, I’ve written down some small nuggets of advice on making that relationship fruitful.


# Trust

This is the biggest problem. Repeated games over long periods of time are the best ways to incentivize people to work well together, eg. being honest, having alignment of values, etc. -- you don’t have this with contractors.

This problem manifests in many ways. Here are some examples of what has happened to me in the past:

* Deadline misspecification: in multiple instances we questioned how long specific features would take and we got back blithe responses that disagreed with our intuitions
* Security concerns: we repeatedly asked to ensure user security without checks on our part. Because we were not checking, security was deprioritized and we had issues during launch

So how do you solve these problems? Well getting to that ideal of a repeated game over a long period of time is the goal. Below are some tips for achieving that (by no means a complete list):

1. Work with them on a similar project before starting a large one (start with a small feature of the overall design) 
1. Know them personally. At least you’ll be in a repeated personal game 
1. Have them guaranteed by a larger organization. This shows they have played the game for an extended period of time with other organizations 
1. Give them skin in the game. If it is enough it can solve the agency problem entirely

## Inspectability
This goes hand in hand with the trust issue above. Don’t let contractors use a technical architecture that you have not used before and you don’t understand, even if they say it is their forte. This leads to a battery of other issues: you won’t know where the code lives, understand how to test it, and could not offer support when bugs popped up.

If you don’t understand how to build it yourself, you’ll need to take other’s word on critical parts of functionality - which would only be fine with a high quality actor that earned our trust.

A second part of inspectability is that you should meet with your contractors every day. Frequent syncs are especially important. You will not work together for a long time, so if there is an issue you will need to bring it up early and often. By having frequent contact you will have less of a chance to drift and a better chance to catch things early.

## Interviews
A very simple tip is to interview the person that is going to work with you like you would interview your employees. To me this was non-obvious, but after working a couple of times with contractors, this seems quite necessary. 

You will oftentimes have a higher bar for contractors than employees, because you will not be able to change or teach them. The nice part about employees is that you can invest in them because they will be with you for a long time. Contractors for the most part will start the job with the same skills that they start with, and the same behavior. 

So if values, aptitude, skills is how you would evaluate employees, then communication and skills is how I would evaluate contractors. My advice is to ask contractors for portfolio examples that match what you have done, references, and an hour to work together before moving forward with anybody in particular.

This is by no means a complete list and I plan to update it more as I continue to improve. But hopefully you’ll avoid some of the pitfalls I encountered when moving to this type of relationship.
