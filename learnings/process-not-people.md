# Process not people
One of the most valuable learnings I had at a startup was: focus on process not people.

When you are working, problems crop up. And this is even more so when you are working with other people. Your first intuition is to immediately blame other people. 

## An example

Let’s say you told Larry to create marketing material that will ship with your ads. You get an email with the materials and find it lacking. A first reaction might be: Larry is not good at his job. And that might be true, but often that is not the case. Train your intuition to focus on process not people. Think about the process that brought about the bad outcome. 

Your process in this case is: talk to Larry and give him a deadline for new work, check back in at the deadline. And as soon as you articulate it, you can start to see potential improvements. Perhaps Larry had latched on to an idea you disagreed with and if you caught it earlier you would have avoided the problem itself. Maybe more frequent checks or collaborations will fix the problem before it happens. 

Ultimately every human interaction has a process, whether spoken or unspoken. And when something goes wrong, force yourself to articulate that process and change it to avoid future problems. Let’s talk about how you’d do that.

## Three intuitions

This type of a strategy reminds me of Dalio’s steps to solving problems. 

1. Have clear goals.
1. Identify and don't tolerate problems that stand in the way of your achieving your goals.
1. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes.
1. Design plans that will get you around them.
1. Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results.

While the above is a nice general framework, I think we can simplify it a bit for our task at hand.

If you think somebody is doing something wrong, your first intuition should be to ask: is there a process for doing what they did? If not, then that is probably the problem.  

Work together to articulate a mutually beneficial process. And follow it. Often this will be enough to collaborate effectively and have realistic expectations.

Your second intuition should be: okay there is a process we should be following, but what happened was not covered by that process. (Now the beautiful thing here is that this shows that process can be built up incrementally. You can start with a process that covers 90% of the cases and then wait till things break down later to fix it.) So revisit the process again and try to patch it up.

The real problem comes when people don’t stick to the process. Now you are starting to get to the point where there might be a real problem. But before you reach that conclusion, your third intuition should be: what is wrong with the process such that people can’t follow it. Maybe if they are a night owl, move your morning meeting till later in the day. Try to compromise to reach a solution that is best for you both.

Only if this doesn’t work should you think about people as the problem.

## Assuming intent

There is one other caution with blaming people and not the process that I want to bring up, because this one can be especially pernicious. Assuming intent.

Let’s go through an example. You see Sergie chewing gum with his mouth open. Your mind might immediately follow this chain of logic without you realizing it: Sergie chews gum with his mouth open, doesn’t he know that behavior is rude, he does know he just does not care, in fact he is intentionally trying to annoy me, he must really dislike me to do that, he probably hates me, he’s a bad person.

You can see the problem here. Humans have a power ability to vilify their opponents (some evolutionary trick to short circuit our natural empathy for each other). And if you find yourself vilifying your coworkers or your boss, you will find it very hard to ever work with them again.

One solution to this is Hanlon’s Razor (blame laziness rather than malevolence). But the way I’d put it is don’t start by assuming intent. Start at the simplest assumption and prove that is wrong. So start off by assuming that Sergie does not know that the behavior is annoying and let him know with that assumption in mind (so in a really nice way).

## Conclusion

If you focus on the process not the people, you will articulate your problems better and incrementally improve the way you work. Just remember that the sooner you address these problems, the smaller the problems will be and the better you will get at solving them.
