# Everything Goes

There is that old quote: I am the wisest man in Athens because I alone know that I know nothing. But I think you should rather go: I know everything I know has exceptions. And this couldn't be more true than in startups.

I think this is even more important to add in a catalog of startup lessons. That's the lesson that all of the lessons here have exceptions.

## How To Found

When I was starting companies I was under the firm belief that all good companies should be founded by a team of technical founders with equal equity. In fact I was so convinced by this fake rule it felt like I had blinders on. I restricted the people I could found with, and boxed myself out of many options. And ultimately my founding situation had neither of those qualifications. In going through Y Combinator I've seen start ups with all different types of founding stories. And while statistically some types of founding situation's are more successful than others, I doubt there is any founding situation that has zero successes. In startups everything goes.
