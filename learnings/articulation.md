# Articulation

Articulation or more simply put, writing shit down, can be a great help when working at a startup. This is an odd lesson because it’s a contradictory one (cough cough PG). 

Going into a startup you might think to yourself: things change so much and so quickly that you don’t need to write anything down. Not only that but if you wrote everything down you could not keep up.

In my experience not only can you write things down, but you should, and there are a heap of good reasons to do so.

## Two heads

This is where that old saying about two heads comes in to play in force. The most powerful thing about writing things down is it’s the best scalable way to get something from your head into somebody else’s - and that is when the magic happens.

If something is not written down, then it is very likely not being well communicated. And most likely that thing is only in one person’s head and nowhere else. This is bad for a whole host of reasons. 

1. Makes information silos. Only some people have some information. This creates a bad feeling all around and makes it very hard to coordinate efforts with other people
1. Leads to bad ideas. Discussing and idea in the first place can be a great way to work the kinks out of it. The more people have eyes on the idea, the more chances that you find something wrong about it. And yes, of course you can have too many eyes on the idea, but in my view that is a good problem to have.
1. Hard to onboard. The more you write down, the easier it will be to onboard new people and the easier it will be to get them to open up about what is wrong with your system. They can see what you have done historically and what you did to get here. There are few better ways to get people on the same page as you than to have them look at the same primary source and get to the same conclusion.
1. Gets lost in the pile of ideas. If you don’t write it down you will forget about it.

The above are what I’d call the obvious reasons that we all know and love. But the rationale behind an articulative frame of mind goes much deeper. Let me add two more reasons why as a startup you should focus on articulation as a part of the team culture.

## Historical accuracy

First a very pernicious problem: if you don’t write it down, you will likely not learn from it. I refer to this as historical accuracy. If you don’t write down what you did in the past then you will have a tendency to forget your mistakes. You will rewrite history to make you right all along. This means less learning. And learning is the most important thing you can do at a startup or anywhere. 

In a way it reminds of the old Ray Dalio stories. Every trade that he’d make, he’d write down the reason why he made the trade. Then later on he would revisit all of the trades and reasons behind them (trades for the first order explanation why he was wrong and the reasons being the second order). In such a way he could not forget his past mistakes or come up with excuses for why his trades went sour. 

So what do we learn from this? Write down your decisions and the reasons behind them to accelerate the speed at which you learn. And we all know that startups are all about acceleration. 

## Writing a plan

Plans are great, even despite the fact that they change all the time. Articulating that plan is even better.

Writing a plan down will force you to know what you are talking about. Before you write it down and have other people scrutinize it, you can protect yourself with abstractions. But once it is written down you will start to notice flaws, and so will others. Don’t be afraid to break down fluffy abstract parts of the plan down to its constituent parts.

Once it is written down you get a whole host of goodies.

1. Progress against the plan. Watching that progress get filled out can be super exciting and a motivator for the team.
1. Clear expectations of yourself and others. I cannot tell you how important this is with interpersonal relationships and coordination in teams
1. Focus and priorities. Writing the plan down will help you think incrementally and focus the team on what is important.
1. Real criticism. Without concrete plans, when something goes wrong there will only be abstract criticism. This will often be personal (about people and not process) and will never be helpful. If the plan is written down then people will have a tendency to give concrete and helpful feedback

Writing the plan is only just the first part of it. If you plan on repeating the plan again and again (think of a plan to generate new creative for your ad campaign), you need to stick with the plan as well. If you don’t write the process down and follow the defined steps, then your actions and implementation will be slightly different each time you do it. This means it is harder to debug. This means there is more room for human error. This means that it is harder to improve. It becomes about the person doing it, not the process. 

If you need to change the plan, discuss it and write the changes down.

So write down your decisions, rationales, and plans as you navigate through the turbulent waters of a startup. While it may seem like a pain at first, I promise it is a decision you won’t regret. Unless you don’t write it down of course.
