# Don't Work With Assholes

There's a famous piece by PG that talks about how counterintuitive startups are. However, in this article he mentions one thing that remains intuitive in startups, and that is people. Many times people throw out their intuitions when working with others. Someone will seem like a super good technical fit or someone will seem very impressive. And you justify their bad behavior to yourself.

I've personally seen and done this far too many times not to learn this lesson. But work with people who you could be friends with. Don't justify people's bad traits - it's far more important to work with someone that works well with others than works well alone. You would never include a package on your site if it meant you couldn't include any other package, regardless of how good it is. 

## Good time hide bad behavior

The worst part about this learning is that it becomes most important when other things aren't working. In good times when the pie is growing and the future seems bright, there won't be as many arguments. They'll be less hostility between you your cofounders and your coworkers. And there won't be anyone to blame.

The problem about bad behavior, is that it comes out when times are tough. When there's a ton of pressure. Or when a sale doesn't work out. Bad actors will look for someone to blame that isn't their self. Or cause more tension need be. Because if you can't win together at least I can win some thing from my coworkers - that's close to the logic that goes through the head of a bad actor. 

And I've seen this time and time again, where the inklings of bad behavior or misgivings that you intuitively felt on meeting somebody, come out in bad times.

## Behavior never changes

Of course this isn't right. But it's a better heuristic to have them believing it will change (at least you'll be positively surprised if it does happen). If a fight over equity broke out at the beginning of your startup, it's likely that a fight will break out in the future. People don't change. 

This is not to be confused with the lessons from Process Not People. That is about getting work done, prioritizing things, communicating events with the team. Bad behavior isn't about that. It's about feeling and acting like you're in this together. Not scapegoating people. Not trying to win over your teammates.

Start ups are hard enough without having to battle your own teammates.
