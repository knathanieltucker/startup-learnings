# Startup Learnings

A small set of principles I learned while working and running startups:

* [Articulation](./learnings/articulation.md): Positive externalities of writing things down
* [Incrementalism](./learnings/incrementalism.md): A practical explanation of the many benefits of being incremental
* [Blame Process, Not People](./learnings/process-not-people.md): When things go wrong, your first instinct should be to blame the way your team works together, not the people on the team
* [Timid Technical Advice](./learnings/technical.md): Loosely held beliefs on how to build a web app
* [Contractors](./learnings/contractors.md): Two nuggets of wisdom when working with contractors
* [Distribution](./learnings/distribution.md): Untested thoughts on distribution

I ordered the above based on how strongly I believe and have seen the principles work. I'd love your thoughts on the articles so don't hesitate to reach out.
